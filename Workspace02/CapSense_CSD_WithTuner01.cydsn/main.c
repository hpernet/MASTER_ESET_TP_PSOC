*
* Description:
*  The project explains the usage of CapSense CSD component. The 2 buttons and
*  linear sliders are used as sensing elements. Tuner GUI displays buttons 
*  active state and slider position. The defualt parameters of component could 
*  be changed by using Tuner GUI. For more information about Tuner GUI please 
*  refer to CapSense CSD data sheet.
*  The EzI2C component is used to establish communication with Tuner GUI.
*
*  Steps to lanch and use Tunner:
*   1) Select "Launch Tuner" from a CapSense CSD instance context menu to
*      launch the Tuning GUI.
*   2) Open the Configuration Communication dialog and set the communication
*      parameters.
*   3) Press Start on the Tuning GUI. All of the CapSense elements will start
*      showing their values.
*
* Hardware connections:
*  CY8CKIT-001 and MiniProg3 GND should be connected.
*  EzI2C Slave SDA - P12[1] to SDAT on MiniProg3.
*  EzI2C Slave SCL - P12[0] to SCLK on MiniProg3.
*  No connection is required for the modulator capacitor Cmod (P2[7] on
*  CY8C38 Family Processor Module CY8CKIT-009).
*  NOTE: To use this project with CY8C55 Family Processor Module CY8CKIT-010
*        reassign the Cmod to P15[5].
